# #FlutterCreate Run submission

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This my submission for the [FlutterCreate](https://flutter.dev/create) contest which consists of creating a nice user experience in less than 5KB of code.

The application is inspired by Running apps and consists of a list of runs. I tried to put as much things in a single little app : custom animated drawing with animated paths, custom data, dynamic user interactions with a swipe that leads to run details (*this allows for comparing details too*).

Also, I didn't want to rely on heavy dependencies for UI (like Flare, or complex widgets) in order to prove that Flutter has everyting packed-in to create great animated UIs. I still wanted to produce something that feels like a real app!

 I used only two packages : 
 * [flutter_hooks](https://github.com/rrousselGit/flutter_hooks) for reducing a lot stateful widget declarations
 * [path_drawing](https://github.com/dnfield/flutter_path_drawing) for generating paths from string data.

All the code is available in the [lib/main.dart file](lib/main.dart).

## Disclaimer

A lot of bad practices are used in this project since the most important factor here is the codebase size! Don't reproduce it in your regular projects, mainly :

* **Short naming** : a lot of variables are named with a few characters which doesn't make it easy to read.
* **`var` only**: use `final` keyword when your value isn't modified after its declaration
* **Accessing enums by index**: if the enumeration values order changes, you code wouldn't access the right value. 
* **`dynamic` by omitting type declaration**: precise all types when possible.
* **Functions for widgets** : Classes should be declared for widgets instead of functions (or use [functional_widget](https://github.com/rrousselGit/functional_widget) to generate them).
* **Accessing json properties with magic strings**: use code generators to generate serializers ([json_serializable](https://github.com/dart-lang/json_serializable)).
* **Everything in the view** : adopt an architectural pattern (like [BLoC](https://aloisdeniel.com/post/p9OCupX71qaLtGYHpnV0) or [scoped_model](https://github.com/brianegan/scoped_model)) to separate your concerns.
* **A single file** : use multiple files to simplify code organization.
* **No built-in classes** : for example we would have used `TweenSequence` instead of calculate current `Tween` ourselves in the `CustomPainter`.
* **Updating too much UI** : make stateful widgets only when you need updates and don't include parts that don't change when the state is updated.

## Notes 

The pre-baked [runs.json data file](data/run.json) is generated with the [script](bin/points_gen.d) by calling `dart bin/points_gen.d`. The `points` could have been generated at runtime without the 5KB size limit.
